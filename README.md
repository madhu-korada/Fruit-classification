# Fruit-classification
This project deals with the field of computer vision mainly for the application of deep learning in object classification task.

5 different types of fruits will be classified

# Need of the project
To improve the application of computer vision using artificial intelligence evading the manual feature extraction process for object detection, etc.

By incorporating neural networks in vision system, we can enhance the performance and increase the accuracy of the system.

# Methodology
Firstly, we will access pre-acquired image datasets containing various images of fruits.

Since the training is a time expensive process, possibility of GPU computing in a standalone or in cloud compute engine would be used (tentative).

Then we would train our system with images using ALEXNET CNN architecture as proposed in the literature.

The training would be carried out with around 450 images in each class chosen randomly.

The inference system would then use the remaining images in the dataset to validate the classification process.
